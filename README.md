# Real-Time Robot Navigation Simulator (Pygame)

This project demonstrates a **real-time autonomous robot navigation simulator** built using Python and Pygame.

The simulation visualizes how a robot continuously senses obstacles and makes movement decisions inside a grid-based environment — similar to real robotic control systems.

## 🧠 Project Design

### Environment
- Represented as a 2D grid
- `0` → Free space  
- `1` → Obstacle  
- Grid boundaries treated as obstacles

### Robot
- Maintains current position `(x, y)`
- Maintains direction (`N`, `E`, `S`, `W`)
- Moves autonomously using reactive control logic
- Changes direction when obstacles are detected

### Control Logic
- Runs inside a real-time game loop
- Each frame updates robot state and redraws the environment
- Frame rate controls robot movement speed

## 🔌 Mapping to Real Robotics Systems

| Robotics Concept | Simulation Equivalent |
| ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Control loop     | Pygame game loop      |
| Motor movement   | Position updates      |
| Obstacle sensor  | Collision detection   |
| Robot body       | Rendered shape        |
| Debug monitoring | Visual simulation     |

## ⚠️ Limitations

Reactive navigation only

No global path planning

Fixed movement speed

No physics-based dynamics

These limitations are intentional to keep the focus on core control logic.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Keyboard/manual control

Smarter navigation strategies

ROS2-based node implementation

Physics-based simulation

Integration with 3D visualization tools
